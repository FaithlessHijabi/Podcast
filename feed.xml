This episode we have our very first Somali ExMuslim, Hassan.
Hassan is from Kenya and comes from the Somali community, Hassan has helped many ExMuslims in Kenya within the community and thus risking his life in the country. While he's worked endlessly for his freedom and saved up (he reached his goFundMe target along with his savings), Faithless Hijabi is hoping to help him raise his voice and share with us what it is like growing up as a man in a Somali community.
We will talk about the culture, the inherent misogyny you're raised with, and how Hassan has managed to find his way out from a toxic community while taking care of his family ‚ù§Ô∏è

Jesse was born and raised in the UK as Yusef and has recently changed his name to Jesse Clarke this year. Jesse is a survivor of an Islamic child-abduction from the West to the Middle East (Egypt) when he was 4 years old. He left Islam around the age of 21 after seeing both first-hand and through research the awful mistreatment of many people within the faith and because of the faith. He is a staunch advocate of free speech and wants to do all he can to help liberate people that feel trapped within Islam, as well as help to reform the religion.
