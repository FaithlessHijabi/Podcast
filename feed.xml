This episode we have our very first Somali ExMuslim, Hassan.
Hassan is from Kenya and comes from the Somali community, Hassan has helped many ExMuslims in Kenya within the community and thus risking his life in the country. While he's worked endlessly for his freedom and saved up (he reached his goFundMe target along with his savings), Faithless Hijabi is hoping to help him raise his voice and share with us what it is like growing up as a man in a Somali community.
We will talk about the culture, the inherent misogyny you're raised with, and how Hassan has managed to find his way out from a toxic community while taking care of his family ‚ù§Ô∏è
